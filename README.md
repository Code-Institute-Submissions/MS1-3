Do you need brand-new security alarms to protect your Caterham, Banstead, Oxted or Warlingham property? Our experienced security company carries out installations and security alarm maintenance for domestic and commercial clients throughout the UK. Our fully-qualified technicians are available on an emergency basis for jobs at small to large-scale properties â€“ from apartments and estates, to offices and industrial warehouses. We also provide free advice about a range of security alarms, plus obligation-free consultations.


## UX
The purpose of this project is to create static website for a installer of security systems, as the existing website http://www.vigilantsecurity.co.uk/ is visualy unpleasing, unresponsive and did not atract potential customers attention. 

My goal was to make website as simple as possible, with responsive page layout, providing brief services overview, deals, contact form and other means of comunication and a physical address to visit.
